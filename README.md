ADaM in R Asset Library

## Purpose

To provide an open source, modularized toolbox that enables the pharmaceutical programming community to develop ADaM datasets in R.

## Installation

Once the package is available from CRAN you'll be able to install it using `install.packages("admiral")`.

In the meantime you can install the latest release of the package directly from GitHub.

```r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}
remotes::install_github("Roche-GSK/admiral.test") # This is a required dependency of {admiral}
remotes::install_github("Roche-GSK/admiral")
```

## Scope

* Build a toolbox of re-usable functions and utilities to create ADaM datasets using R scripts in a modular manner
* Pharmaceutical communities and companies are encouraged to contribute to admiral following the provided programming strategy and modular approach
* All functions are documented, tested, include examples and are listed in the
[Reference section](https://roche-gsk.github.io/admiral/reference/index.html)
* Vignettes how to create ADSL, BDS and OCCUR datasets, including example scripts
* Vignettes for ADaM dataset specific functionality (i.e. dictionary coding, date imputation, SMQs ...)

## Usage

* Think of admiral as a toolbox of modular blocks (R functions) to create analysis derivations
    * Each block has a stand alone purpose, i.e. each function provides a specific functionality
    * Data Scientists can create their own blocks, i.e. create own R functions

* Constructing ADaM dataset should become like building out of blocks that are based on admiral modular functions and user created modular functions
