ADaM in R Asset Library

### Purpose

To provide an open source, modularized toolbox that enables the pharmaceutical programming community to develop ADaM datasets in R.


### Scope

* Build a toolbox of re-usable functions and utilities to create ADaM datasets in R in a modular manner
* Pharmaceutical communities and companies are encouraged to contribute to admiral following the provided programming strategy and modular approach
* All functions are documented, tested, include examples and are listed [in the Reference section](https://roche-gsk.github.io/admiral/reference/index.html) 
* Vignettes how to create ADSL, BDS and OCCUR datasets, including example scripts
* Vignettes for ADaM dataset specific functionality (i.e. dictionary coding, date imputation, SMQs ...)

### Usage

* Think of admiral as a toolbox of modular blocks (R functions) to create analysis derivations â†’
    * each block has a stand alone purpose (each function provides a specific functionality)
    * Data Scientists can create their own blocks (create own R functions)

* Constructing ADaM dataset should become like building out of blocks that are based on admiral modular functions and user created modular functions
