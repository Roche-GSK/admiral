\title{Derive/Impute a datetime from a date character vector}
\usage{
derive_vars_dtm(dataset, new_vars_prefix, dtc, date_imputation = NULL,
  time_imputation = "00:00:00", flag_imputation = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Input dataset

The date character vector (dtc) must be present.}

\item{new_vars_prefix}{Prefix used for the output variable(s).

a character is expected: e.g new_vars_prefix="AST".}

\item{dtc}{The date character vector used to derive/impute the date.

A character date is expected in a format like yyyy-mm-dd or yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.
if the year part is not recorded (missing date), no imputation is done.}

\item{date_imputation}{The value to impute the day/month when a datepart is missing.

If NULL: no date imputation is performed and partial dates are returned as missing.

Otherwise, a character value is expected, either as a
\itemize{
\item format with day and month specified as 'dd-mm': e.g. '15-06' for the 15th of June,
\item or as a keyword: 'FIRST', 'MID', 'LAST' to impute to the first/mid/last day/month.
}

Default is NULL.}

\item{time_imputation}{The value to impute the time when a timepart is missing.

A character value is expected, either as a
\itemize{
\item format with hour, min and sec specified as 'hh:mm:ss': e.g. '00:00:00' for
the start of the day,
\item or as a keyword: 'FIRST','LAST' to impute to the start/end of a day.
}

Default is '00:00:00'.}

\item{flag_imputation}{Whether the date/time imputation flag(s) must also be derived.

A logical value

Default: TRUE}
}
\value{
the input dataset with the datetime '--DTM' (and the date/time imputation
flag '--DTF', '--TMF') added.
}
\description{
Derive a datetime object ('--DTM') from a date character vector ('---DTC').
The date and time can be imputed (see date_imputation/time_imputation parameters)
and the date/time imputation flag ('--DTF', '--TMF') can be added.
}
\details{
The presence of a --DTF variable is checked and the variable is not derived
if it already exists in the input dataset. However, if --TMF already exists
in the input dataset, a warning is issued and --TMF will be overwritten.
