\usage{
derive_vars_dtm(dataset, new_vars_prefix, dtc, date_imputation = NULL,
  time_imputation = "00:00:00", flag_imputation = TRUE,
  min_dates = NULL, max_dates = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{Input dataset

The date character vector (dtc) must be present.}

\item{new_vars_prefix}{Prefix used for the output variable(s).

a character is expected: e.g new_vars_prefix="AST".}

\item{dtc}{The --DTC date to impute

A character date is expected in a format like yyyy-mm-dd or
yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss. If the year part is not recorded (missing date), no
imputation is performed.}

\item{date_imputation}{The value to impute the day/month when a datepart is
missing.

If \code{NULL}: no date imputation is performed and partial dates are returned as
missing.

Otherwise, a character value is expected, either as a
\itemize{
\item format with day and month specified as 'dd-mm': e.g. \code{"15-06"} for the 15th
of June,
\item or as a keyword: \code{"FIRST"}, \code{"MID"}, \code{"LAST"} to impute to the first/mid/last
day/month.
}

Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{time_imputation}{The value to impute the time when a timepart is
missing.

A character value is expected, either as a
\itemize{
\item format with hour, min and sec specified as 'hh:mm:ss': e.g. \code{"00:00:00"}
for the start of the day,
\item or as a keyword: \code{"FIRST"},\code{"LAST"} to impute to the start/end of a day.
}

Default is \code{"00:00:00"}.}

\item{flag_imputation}{Whether the date/time imputation flag(s) must also be derived.

A logical value

Default: TRUE}

\item{min_dates}{Minimum dates

A list of dates is expected. It is ensured that the imputed date is not
before any of the specified dates, e.g., that the imputed adverse event start
date is not before the first treatment date. Only dates which are in the
range of possible dates of the dtc value are considered. The possible dates
are defined by the missing parts of the dtc date (see example below). This
ensures that the non-missing parts of the dtc date are not changed. For
example\preformatted{impute_dtc(
  "2020-11",
  min_dates = list(ymd_hms("2020-12-06T12:12:12"),
                   ymd_hms("2020-11-11T11:11:11")),
  date_imputation = "first"
)
}

returns \code{"2020-11-11T11:11:11"} because the possible dates for \code{"2020-11"}
range from \code{"2020-11-01T00:00:00"} to \code{"2020-11-30T23:59:59"}. Therefore
\code{"2020-12-06T12:12:12"} is ignored. Returning \code{"2020-12-06T12:12:12"} would
have changed the month although it is not missing (in the dtc date).}

\item{max_dates}{Maximum dates

A list of dates is expected. It is ensured that the imputed date is not after
any of the specified dates, e.g., that the imputed date is not after the data
cut off date. Only dates which are in the range of possible dates are
considered.}

\value{
the input dataset with the datetime '--DTM' (and the date/time imputation
flag '--DTF', '--TMF') added.
}
\description{
Derive a datetime object ('--DTM') from a date character vector ('---DTC').
The date and time can be imputed (see date_imputation/time_imputation parameters)
and the date/time imputation flag ('--DTF', '--TMF') can be added.
}
\details{
The presence of a --DTF variable is checked and the variable is not derived
if it already exists in the input dataset. However, if --TMF already exists
in the input dataset, a warning is issued and --TMF will be overwritten.
