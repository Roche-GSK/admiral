\usage{
filter_extreme_multisource(sources, by_vars, order, mode)
}
\arguments{
\item{sources}{List of sources

For each source the observations are selected as specified. The selected
observations of all sources are collected in one dataset and then for each
by group one observation (with respect to the \code{order} and \code{mode} parameter)
is selected and merged to the input dataset.

Each element of the list must be a list with the following named elements.

\itemize{
\item \emph{dataset:}
Dataset to add

The variables specified by the \code{by_vars} parameter, the \code{filter}, and the
\code{order} element are expected.

\item \emph{filter:} Filter condition for dataset

Only observations of the dataset which fulfill the specified condition
are used for merging.

\emph{Permitted Values:} logical expression

\item \emph{new_vars:} Variable to add

The specified variables are created in the add dataset and then merge to
the input dataset.

\emph{Permitted Values:} list of name-value pairs

\item \emph{order:} Sort order

If the parameter is specified, the source dataset is ordered by the
specified order and only the first or last observation (depending on the
mode) in each by group is used for merging.

\emph{Permitted Values:} list of variables or functions of variables

\item \emph{mode:} mode

If the \code{filter_order} parameter is specified, the mode determines if
the first or last observation of each by group is selected.

\emph{Permitted Values:} \code{"first"}, \code{"last"}
}}

\item{by_vars}{Grouping variables

Default: \code{exprs(USUBJID)}

Permitted Values: list of variables}

\item{order}{Sort order

If the parameter is specified, all selected observations from the source
dataset are ordered by the specified order and only the first or last
observation (depending on the filter mode) in each by group is used for
merging.

The temporary variable \code{temp_source_nr}, which is set to the number of the
source, can be used for ordering. It is not included in the output dataset.

Permitted Values: list of variables or functions of variables}

\item{mode}{Filter mode

If the \code{order} parameter is specified, the filter mode determines if the
first or last observation of each by group is selected.

Permitted Values: \code{"first"}, \code{"last"}}
}
\value{
A dataset containing the first or last observation of each by group.
Only the by variables and the new variables are included.
}
\description{
Merges variables from more than one dataset. For each dataset the
observations to merge can be selected by a condition and/or by selecting the
first or last observation in each by group.
}
\details{
For each group (with respect to the variables specified for the
\code{by_vars} parameter) the first observation (with respect to the order
specified for the \code{order} parameter) is included in the output dataset.
