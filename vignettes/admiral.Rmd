# Main Idea

The main idea of `{admiral}` is that an ADaM dataset is built by a sequence of
derivations. Each derivation adds one or more variables or records to the
processed dataset. This modular approach makes it easy to adjust code by adding,
removing, or modifying derivations. Each derivation is a function call. 

In this vignette we will explore some of the different type of derivation functions 
offered by `{admiral}`, as well as the argument conventions they follow and how best 
to start an `{admiral}` script. 

# Setup

To help with the examples showcased, we will load some packages and set up some example 
data to manipulate later. The `{dplyr}`, `{lubridate}` and `{stringr}` packages are 
`{tidyverse}` packages and are used heavily throughout this vignette. The `{admiral}`
package also leverages the `{pharmaversesdtm}` package for example SDTM datasets 
which are from the CDISC Pilot Study.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Uncomment line below if you need to install these packages
# install.packages(c("dplyr", "lubridate", "stringr", "tibble", "pharmaversesdtm", "admiral"))

library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(tibble)
library(pharmaversesdtm)
library(admiral)

# Read in SDTM datasets
data("dm")
data("ds")
data("ex")
data("vs")
data("admiral_adsl")
```

The `adsl` and `advs` objects will now be prepared to showcase [addition of variables](#addvars)
and [addition of records](#addrecs) later.

```{r}
ex_ext <- ex %>%
  derive_vars_dtm(
    dtc = EXSTDTC,
    new_vars_prefix = "EXST"
  )

vs <- vs %>%
  filter(
    USUBJID %in% c(
      "01-701-1015", "01-701-1023", "01-703-1086",
      "01-703-1096", "01-707-1037", "01-716-1024"
    ) &
      VSTESTCD %in% c("SYSBP", "DIABP") &
      VSPOS == "SUPINE"
  )

adsl <- admiral_adsl %>%
  select(-TRTSDTM, -TRTSTMF)

advs <- vs %>%
  mutate(
    PARAM = VSTEST, PARAMCD = VSTESTCD, AVAL = VSSTRESN, AVALU = VSORRESU,
    AVISIT = VISIT, AVISITN = VISITNUM
  )
```

**Note:** In the example above, we are reading in dummy R data from 
`{pharmaversesdtm}`. However, if you are using SAS datasets as a starting point, 
be sure to consult the section [Handling of Missing Values](concepts_conventions.html#missing) 
in the [Programming Concepts and Conventions](concepts_conventions.html) User Guide
to learn how and why you should use the function `convert_blanks_to_na()` during 
this process.

# Derivation Functions

The most important functions in `{admiral}` are the
[derivations](../reference/index.html#derivations-for-adding-variables).
Derivations add variables or observations/records to the input dataset. Existing
variables and observations of the input dataset are not changed. Derivation
functions start with `derive_`. The first argument of these functions expects
the input dataset. This allows us to string together derivations using the `%>%`
operator.

Functions which derive a dedicated variable start with `derive_var_` followed by
the variable name, e.g., `derive_var_trtdurd()` derives the `TRTDURD` variable.

Functions which can derive multiple variables start with `derive_vars_` followed
by the variable name, e.g., `derive_vars_dtm()` can derive both the `TRTSDTM`
and `TRTSTMF` variables.

Functions which derive a dedicated parameter start with `derive_param_` followed by
the parameter name, e.g., `derive_param_bmi()` derives the `BMI` parameter.

## Example: Adding Variables {#addvars}

Below we can see an example call to one of the most common derivation functions,
`derive_vars_merged()`. This function adds variable(s) to the input dataset based on the 
contents of another dataset. In this example, we add the treatment start datetime and 
corresponding imputation flag (`EXSTTMF`) to `adsl` by identifying the first record
in `ex` with a non-missing Exposure Start Datetime (`EXSTDTM`) when sorting by `EXSTDM` 
and `EXSEQ`.

```{r, eval = TRUE}
adsl <- adsl %>%
  derive_vars_merged(
    dataset_add = ex_ext,
    filter_add = !is.na(EXSTDTM),
    new_vars = exprs(TRTSDTM = EXSTDTM, TRTSTMF = EXSTTMF),
    order = exprs(EXSTDTM, EXSEQ),
    mode = "first",
    by_vars = exprs(STUDYID, USUBJID)
  )
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(
  adsl,
  display_vars = exprs(USUBJID, TRTSDTM, TRTSTMF)
)
```

## Example: Adding Records {#addrecs}

Another common derivation function is `derive_param_computed()`. This function
adds a derived parameter to an input dataset. In the example below, we use it
to derive the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the Systolic and Diastolic values
of the blood pressure. The parameters that are needed for the derivation are 
specified in the `parameters` argument, and within `set_values_to` we set all 
the variable values for the new derived record.

```{r eval=TRUE}
advs <- advs %>%
  derive_param_computed(
    by_vars = exprs(USUBJID, AVISIT, AVISITN),
    parameters = c("SYSBP", "DIABP"),
    set_values_to = exprs(
      AVAL = (AVAL.SYSBP + 2 * AVAL.DIABP) / 3,
      PARAMCD = "MAP",
      PARAM = "Mean Arterial Pressure (mmHg)",
      AVALU = "mmHg"
    )
  )
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
advs %>%
  arrange(USUBJID, AVISITN, PARAMCD) %>%
  dataset_vignette(
    display_vars = exprs(USUBJID, AVISIT, PARAMCD, AVAL)
  )
```

**Note:** For the users' convenience, `{admiral}` actually provides
`derive_param_map()`  (wrapper of `derive_param_computed()`) to derive MAP.
The above example serves for illustrative purposes only.

# Other Types of Functions

Along with the derivation functions, `{admiral}` provides a large arsenal
of functions to help you with your ADaM derivations. Here are some of the 
other categories.

## Higher Order Functions

[Higher order functions](../reference/index.html#higher-order) 
are `{admiral}` functions that take other functions as input. 
They enhance the existing portfolio of derivation functions by allowing greater 
customization of the latter's behavior. This is done by allowing a derivation
function to be:

* `call_derivation()` - Called multiple times, while varying some of the input arguments.
* `restrict_derivation()` - Executed on a subset of the input dataset.
* `slice_derivation()` - Executed differently on subsets of the input dataset.

Higher order functions are a relatively advanced topic within `{admiral}`; you can
can read all about them in the dedicated vignette about
[Higher Order Functions](../reference/index.html#higher_order).

## Computation Functions

[Computations](../reference/index.html#computation-functions-for-vectors) expect vectors as
input and return a vector. Usually these computation functions can not be used with `%>%`. 
These functions can be used in expressions like `convert_dtc_to_dt()` in the derivation
of the Final Lab Visit Date (`FINLABDT`) in the example below:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
# Add the date of the final lab visit to ADSL
adsl <- dm %>%
  derive_vars_merged(
    dataset_add = ds,
    by_vars = exprs(USUBJID),
    new_vars = exprs(FINLABDT = convert_dtc_to_dt(DSSTDTC)),
    filter_add = DSDECOD == "FINAL LAB VISIT"
  )
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(
  adsl,
  display_vars = exprs(STUDYID, USUBJID, FINLABDT)
)
```

Computations can also be used inside a `mutate()` statement (or similar), so they
can be leveraged when your variable derivations do not require calls to specific
`{admiral}` functions:

```{r, eval=TRUE}
adsl <- adsl %>%
  mutate(RFSTDT = convert_dtc_to_dt(RFSTDTC))
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(
  adsl,
  display_vars = exprs(STUDYID, USUBJID, RFSTDTC, RFSTDT)
)
```

## Filter Functions

[Filter functions](../reference/index.html#utilities-for-filtering-observations) are `{admiral}`
utilities that filter the input dataset in different manners, for instance returning records 
that fit/don't fit a certain condition or that are the first/last observation in a by group.
These functions form an important internal backbone to some of the `{admiral}` functions, but
can also be used on their own to explore or manipulate a dataset. For instance, in the example 
below we use `filter_extreme()` to extract the most recent MAP records in `advs`:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
advs_lastmap <- advs %>%
  filter(PARAMCD == "MAP") %>%
  filter_extreme(
    by_vars = exprs(USUBJID),
    order = exprs(AVISITN, PARAMCD),
    mode = "last"
  )
```

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
dataset_vignette(
  advs_lastmap,
  display_vars = exprs(USUBJID, AVISIT, PARAMCD, AVAL)
)
```

# Argument Conventions 

Within the `{admiral}` package, any arguments which expect variable names or expressions of variable names, symbols or 
expressions must be specified rather than strings.

- For arguments which expect a single variable name, the name can be specified without quotes and quotation, e.g.
`new_var = TEMPBL`

- For arguments which expect one or more variable names, a list of symbols is expected, e.g. `by_vars = exprs(PARAMCD, AVISIT)` 

- For arguments which expect a single expression, the expression needs to be passed "as is", e.g. `filter = PARAMCD == "TEMP"`

- For arguments which expect one or more expressions, a list of expressions is expected, e.g. `order = exprs(AVISIT, desc(AESEV))`

If you are new to expressions, consider reading the [Expressions in Scripts](concepts_conventions.html#exprs) section 
of our [Concepts and Conventions](concepts_conventions.html) User Guide to learn more.

# Starting a Script

For the ADaM data structures, an overview of the flow and example function calls
for the most common steps are provided by the following vignettes:

- [Creating ADSL](adsl.html)
- [Creating an OCCDS ADaM](occds.html)
- [Creating a BDS Findings ADaM](bds_finding.html)

`{admiral}` also provides template R scripts as a starting point. They can be
created by calling `use_ad_template()`, e.g.,

```r
use_ad_template(
  adam_name = "adsl",
  save_path = "./ad_adsl.R"
)
```

A list of all available templates can be obtained by `list_all_templates()`:

```{r}
library(admiral)
list_all_templates()
```
