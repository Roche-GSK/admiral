#  Dear Developers

`{admiraldev}` is intended for you, the developer, to help make developing within the admiral family easier and consistently robust and maybe even fun!  

Tools are loosely defined as follows:

* Utility Functions used in `{admiral}` and `{admiral}` extension functions for doing custom checks and providing custom messages, warnings and errors.  These cusotm messages, warnings and errors are succint, but helpful messaging around what a function expects as inputs. The inputs to admiral functions are many, but generally fit into three categories: datasets, variables and arguments. Most of the functions start with `assert_`, `is_` or `get_`.

* Addins and utility functions that help with documentation, testing and checking on health of the code base in all admiral packages.

* Vignettes on working on `{admiral}` functions, developing unit testing, releases process, vignette writing and other documenation.  These vignettes are intended for use across admiral packages.

# Adding new tools

* Just like in `{admiral}`, we follow the same procedures of adding issues, developing those issues in branches and doing a Pull Request.  

* Experimental tools are highly encouraged to help reduce repetitive patterns and automating the boring stuff.
