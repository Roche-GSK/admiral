# Introduction 

This vignette gives you an overview of the anticipated contribution model.
The goal is to enable users of `{admiral}` to contribute and test the contribution model for `{admiral}`. Adjustments might be made over time.
 
We advise you to contact us when an issue is created via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) _(If you don't have access, use this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/pharmaverse/shared_invite/zt-yv5atkr4-Np2ytJ6W_QKz_4Olo7Jo9A) to join)_.  We can discuss details or align expectations if you are not familiar with the `{admiral}` philosophy and programming strategy. The team will try to review the issues within the next sprint and give some initial feedback. Since we are not a 100% fully resourced software development team it might be that some issues will take longer to respond to depending on the amount of overall issues. 

# Basics
 * For each new contribution, the user creates an issue on the issue tab on [GitHub](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues) to put it in our backlog. 
 
 * Familiarize yourself with our [programming
 strategy](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/devel/articles/programming_strategy.html),
 guidance for [GitHub
 usage](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/devel/articles/git_usage.html)
 and [unit
 testing](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiraldev/devel/articles/unit_test_guidance.html).

 * All [created issues](https://github.com/pharmaverse/admiral/issues) will be reviewed within the next sprint and the creator will receive an initial feedback via a comment. Someone from the core development team will then triage new issues by assigning the appropriate labels (such as “user request” so we can easily identify new requests).
 
 * Issues are meant to be taken on by users from the Pharma programming
 community and not exclusively by the `{admiral}` team from GSK and Roche.

# Contribution Model

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='120%'}
knitr::include_graphics("./admiral_contribution_model.png")
```

Type 1 Contribution without Code: 

 * User creates an issue and ideally contacts an `{admiral}` team member via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269).
 
 * The `{admiral}` core development team will contact the issue creator as soon as possible to discuss further details.
 
Type 2 Contribution with Code: 

 * User creates an issue or comments on an existing issue to notify that they’d like to contribute code.
 
 * We advise to contact the `{admiral}` core development team directly via [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269) before submitting code for complex functionality.
 
  * Once an issue is assigned to you by admiral core development team, follow our step-by-step guide in the development process section below, or checkout the [admiral contributor onboarding Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcDxBmlpykw&t=6s).


## Development Process
If you decide to contribute with code and you’re ready to make your first code 
contribution, this development process step-by-step guide will help tie all the 
other detailed vignettes together to give you the simplest experience of helping 
to grow and enhance our codebase.

1. Create a new feature branch from the development branch `main` following the naming convention and pull the latest changes - as detailed on the [github usage](git_usage.html#working-with-feature-branches-1) guide.
1. Familiarize yourself with the `{admiral}` [programming
strategy](programming_strategy.html), and then make the required code updates.
1. Before making a pull request, check the [Pull Request Review Guidance](pr_review_guidance.html) & the following checklist of common things developers miss:
    a. Is all your code formatted according to the [tidyverse](https://style.tidyverse.org/) style guide?
    a. Did you create/add appropriate [unit tests](unit_test_guidance.html#writing-unit-tests-in-admiral)?
    a. If you removed/replaced any function and/or function parameters, did you fully follow the [deprecation guidance](programming_strategy.html#deprecation)?
    a. Did you update the [documentation](programming_strategy.html#function-header-documentation)? If so, remember to run `devtools::document()` and include the updated `NAMESPACE` and `.Rd` files in `man/` 
    a. Does your code update have any impact on the [ADaM template](https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/cran-release/articles/admiral.html#starting-a-script) R scripts stored in `inst/templates`?
    a. Does your code update have any impact on the vignettes stored in vignettes?
    a. Did you update the Changelog `NEWS.md`?
    a. Did you build `{admiral}` site `pkgdown::build_site()` and check that all affected examples are displayed correctly and that all new functions occur on the "[Reference](../reference/index.html)" page?
1. Once happy with all the updates, make a [pull request](git_usage.html#pull-request) to merge to the `main` branch and link the issue so that it closes after successful merging.
1. Check that there are no merge conflicts. If there are any, fix them before requesting review. See [solving merge conflicts](git_usage.html#solving-merge-conflicts-in-the-terminal-on-rstudio) guidance.
1. Check the results of the automated `R-CMD check` and `lintr` checks and if any issues consult this [guide](pr_review_guidance.html#common-r-cmd-check-issues).
1. Assign a reviewer from the `{admiral}` core development team – this could be
anyone you discussed the issue with previously via Slack or GitHub. If unsure,
add a comment that the pull request is ready for review and add the
`@pharmaverse/admiral` tag to it.
1. Once the review is completed, the reviewer will merge the PR and this will then automatically delete the feature branch.

_Finally, just a note to say from the core developers that we hugely appreciate
you taking the time to contribute to `{admiral}`. Don’t be offended if during
review we send requests back to you, as the expectations are high so that we can
ensure the `{admiral}` codebase remains robust and consistent. The best way to learn
here is always to jump in and get involved, so please don’t be afraid you’ll
make mistakes along the way – we all have and continue to do so, and that’s what
the reviews are for. Also if ever you get stuck don't hesitate to reach out for
support via the [Slack
channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T028PB489D3/C02M8KN8269). **Welcome to our
`{admiral}` community!**_
